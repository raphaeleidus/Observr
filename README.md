## What is Observr? ##
Observr is a tool for Observing and Analyzing activities. Originially Observr was intended for User Centered Design but in almost any senario where observation is going to happen, Observr can help.

## How Observr Works ##
Observr has two main sections, Observation and Analysis. With other forms of observation notation (ie: Pencil and Paper) the process of the converting the raw log to a form ready for analysis is a laborious process with little reward but with Observr that process is instantaneous.

## The interface is confusing ##
In interface design there is often a give and take between productivity and intuitivity. Observr was designed to be incredibly productive so concessions were made to the inuitiveness, this resulted in a great product that when someone new sits down to use it, they dont really know what is going on.
